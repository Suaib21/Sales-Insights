# Sales-Insights
In my Sales Insights Power BI project for the hospitality domain, I leveraged Power BI Desktop to create an impactful dashboard that provides valuable insights to management. With a focus on data modeling, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) using Power Query, and advanced calculations using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions), I successfully delivered a comprehensive solution for analyzing sales data and driving informed decision-making. 

By gathering and analyzing the available sales data, identified opportunities to provide actionable insights and improve business performance. To start, I utilized Power Query to extract data from various data sources within the organization, such as transactional databases, customer relationship management systems, or third-party data providers. By performing transformations and data cleansing operations, I ensured that the data was clean, standardized, and ready for analysis. 

Next, applied my expertise in data modeling to design a robust and efficient data model. This involved creating relationships between different tables and defining hierarchies and measures. By structuring the data effectively, enabled seamless navigation and drill-down capabilities within the dashboard, allowing management to gain insights at different levels of granularity. 

Using DAX performed additional calculations and created custom measures that aligned with the hospitality domain's specific requirements. These measures encompassed key metrics like revenue, average daily rate (ADR), occupancy rate, customer acquisition cost (CAC), and other relevant indicators. These calculations provided a deeper understanding of sales performance and helped identify trends, patterns, and areas for improvement. The culmination of the project was the creation of an impressive and visually appealing dashboard in Power BI Desktop. Leveraging the vast array of data visualization options available, I designed intuitive charts, graphs, tables, and interactive visuals that presented the sales insights in a clear and compelling manner. The dashboard allowed management to explore data, slice and dice information, and gain actionable insights through intuitive filters and interactive features.
 
Overall, my Sales Insights Power BI project for the hospitality domain demonstrated my proficiency in Power BI Desktop, data modeling, ETL using Power Query, and advanced calculations using DAX. By delivering an impressive and insightful dashboard, I enabled management to make data-driven decisions, optimize sales strategies, and drive business growth in the highly competitive hospitality industry.
